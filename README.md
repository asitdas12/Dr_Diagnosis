By: **Austin John, Asit Das, John Akinmolayan, Jake Miu**

Project completion: Fall 2022

## Summary

**Dr. Diagnosis** is a Python application that **takes in patient health data and predicts whether a patient has heart disease or diabetes based on which diagnosis the user chooses**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

For heart disease and diabetes diagnosis, the following classifiers are implemented: 

- [x] Multi-layer perceptron
- [x] Naive bayes
- [x] Logistic regression

Additionally, an end-user interface has been created to allow for users to input their own patient data

<!-- ## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

I was able to convert training data from numerical to categorical form. Trained naive-bayes model to diagnose given patient lifestyle data with over 70 percent accuracy.
